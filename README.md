# Human Activity Tracking and Classification in a Restaurant

## Project Overview
This project aims to monitor and analyze human activities of restaurant workers using advanced computer vision techniques. By employing YOLO (You Only Look Once) for person tracking and a combination of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for activity recognition, we can efficiently determine whether workers are actively engaged in their tasks.

## 1. Dataset Creation for YOLO Person Tracking

### Overview
To effectively track restaurant workers using YOLO, a custom dataset was created, consisting solely of annotated images that focus on detecting the presence of individuals in a restaurant environment, without specific scenarios.
